The sample hotel and vending Solidity smart contract below allows one to rent a hotel room. It allows someone to make a payment for a room if the room is vacant. After payment is made to the contract the funds are sent to the owner. This smart contract can be expanded to unlock the door or dispense a key code after payment is made.

Think of this contract like a vending machine. You input funds, validations pass, and you get something in return. It is the same concept as a gumball machine.

Experiment with the contract below and learn the basics of a simple contract. Deploy it to the test network using Remix. Enhance the code and add another function.
