The sample hotel and vending Solidity smart contract below allows one to rent a hotel room. 
It allows someone to make a payment for a room if the room is vacant. 
After payment is made to the contract the funds are sent to the owner. 
This smart contract can be expanded to unlock the door or dispense a key code after payment is made.

Think of this contract like a vending machine. 
You input funds, validations pass, and you get something in return.
